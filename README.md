# Fincent

Welcome to the repository for Fincent! This project is designed to demonstrate the integration of API data fetching, storage, backtesting modules, machine learning predictions, and deployment in a Django-based environment. The repository showcases advanced skills in Django development, database management, and deployment.

## 🚀 Overview

This project covers the complete development lifecycle of a financial data management system, from fetching and storing data to implementing backtesting strategies and integrating machine learning predictions. It is tailored for experienced developers proficient in Django and API integration.

### Key Sections
- **Data Fetching** – A Django view or background task that fetches financial data from Alpha Vantage and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Backtesting Module** – A Django API endpoint for executing backtesting strategies with user-input parameters and generating financial performance summaries.
- **ML Integration** – Use of a pre-trained model for predicting stock prices, integrated as a Django API endpoint.
- **Reporting** – A comprehensive reporting tool to visualize and compare predicted and actual stock prices.
- **Deployment** – Production-ready deployment on AWS with Docker and CI/CD pipeline automation.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Django** – Python-based web framework for developing the backend.
- **PostgreSQ**L – Relational database for storing financial data.
- **Alpha Vantage API** – External API for fetching historical stock price data.
- **Docker** – Containerization for scalable and consistent deployment.
- **AWS** – Cloud platform for hosting the application and database.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly** – Visualization libraries for report generation.
- **GitHub Actions – CI/CD** tool for deployment automation.

# ✨ Features

- **API Integration:** Seamless fetching of stock data with error handling for rate limits and network issues.
- **Backtesting Strategy:** User-customizable backtesting with detailed financial metrics.
- **ML Predictions:** Integrated pre-trained model to predict stock prices for the next 30 days.
- **Report Generation:** Visual comparison and performance reports, available as PDF downloads or JSON API responses.
- **Deployment Ready:** Dockerized and deployed on AWS, featuring CI/CD pipeline automation for robust development practices.
